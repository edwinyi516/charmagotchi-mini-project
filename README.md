# "Charmagotchi" Mini Project

![Preview](/img/preview.png)

## Description
<div>
Welcome to my first project! It has been 6 weeks since I wrote my first ever line of code, and I've utilized all I've learned so far to create this humble Tamagotchi-esque app. This project was created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.<br><br>
The process was definitely trial-by-fire as it is the first time I've utilized all three programming languages to build something from the ground up.<br>
I was able to apply wider concepts I've learned such as simple DOM manipulation and object-oriented programming, but was also able to learn new "micro" concepts like using intervals and manipulating CSS through JavaScript to change overall functionality.<br>
Debugging the app instead of fixing a single line of code in a conceptual problem also strengthened my real-world ability to search for, identify, and correct problems in code.<br><br>
Thanks for taking a look! If you have any feedback, it would be more than appreciated through this learning process.
